TI  - A systematic review of the safety and efficacy of performing surgery on human
      subjects by alien surgeons
AB  - Objective: With the increasing human population and their unhealthy habits,
      there has been a relative shortage in  surgeons with human experience. Some
      humans have resorted to surgeons with a alien experience to cover the shortage.
      In this systematic review, we evaluated the literature on outcomes of human
      surgery performed by alien surgeons. Methods: A librarian (TL) performed a
      search of 2,422 databases. The Universal Translater was used to translate all
      results into gibberish for the purposes of duplicate discovered and removal.
      Further duplicate removal by hand was performed by one reviewer (HC). A robot
      was available (BBR). Two independent reviewers (HC and AW) then screened the
      unique citations by title and abstract then by full-text content. Results:
      the initial search resulted in 2.7e21. The Universal Translater removed 1.5e21
      duplicates and another 1.2e21 duplicates were removed by hand. There were 1.2
      million unique citations screened by title and abstract and 23 by full-text.
      Two citations met the inclusion criteria, both were from the same group (the
      authors group). Conclusion: Human surgery by alien surgeons is a promising
      alternative to cover the shortage of human surgeons. However, data on the
      safety of this practice are lacking. More research in this area is needed.
